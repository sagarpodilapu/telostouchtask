# Telos Task

**Done**

Task 1 is done using JavaScript's built in function filter

Task 2:

- added module.exports to remove syntactical errors
- removed the async keyword from postMessagesList() as we are using then() promise.
- updated put() from the messagsMap to set()
- added httpStatus.OK code for the successful response in the end

**Pending**:

- Mocking the database for the integration testing using sinon spies
- Testing promises using chai expect (unit testing)
